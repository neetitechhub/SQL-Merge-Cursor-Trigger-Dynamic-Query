**MERGE**

The MERGE statement in SQL allows you to perform insert, update, or delete operations in a single statement.
This is particularly useful for synchronizing tables. 

TargetTable: This is the table we want to update.
SourceTable: This is the table containing the new data we want to merge into TargetTable.

So Now We have TargetTable with the current data of employees, and SourceTable with updated data of employees. 

We want to:
Update existing employee records in TargetTable if they exist in SourceTable.
Insert new employee records into TargetTable if they do not exist.
Optionally, we can delete records from TargetTable if they are no longer present in SourceTable.


**CURSOR**

1. A cursor in SQL is a database object that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data row-by-row from a result set.
2. Cursors are useful when you need to perform operations on each row individually, rather than operating on the entire result set at once.

**CONS :**

1. Performance Overhead: Row-by-Row Processing: Cursors process each row individually, which can be significantly slower than set-based operations, especially with large result sets.
2. Resource Intensive: Cursors can consume more memory and resources on the database server, particularly if they remain open for long periods.
3. Complexity: Complex Code-> Cursors often require more complex and lengthy code compared to set-based operations, making the SQL scripts harder to read and maintain.
4. Error Handling: Handling errors and exceptions within cursors can be more complicated compared to set-based operations.
5. Concurrency Issues: Locking-> Cursors can hold locks on rows for extended periods, which may lead to blocking and deadlocking issues, affecting the performance and concurrency of the database.
6. Scalability: Not Scalable -> As the size of the data increases, cursor-based operations become less efficient and scalable. Set-based operations are generally more scalable for large datasets.
7. Maintenance: Difficult to Debug-> Debugging cursor-based operations can be more challenging compared to set-based operations due to the complexity of the code and the need to track the cursor state.
